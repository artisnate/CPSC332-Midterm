<!-- Valid IPv4 address: -->
<!-- An example of a valid IPv4 address is 8.8.8.8, since it is the public
DNS server operated by Google. Another example would be 192.168.0.1, which is a 
default gateway address for many home routers. These are valid because they follow
the dotted decimal format and they are within the bounds of 0 and 255. -->

            <h3>Hi! I'm Pancake</h3>
            
            <p>I have almost 5 years of experience of being a guinea
                pig, but 0 years of experience web developing. However, I am very confident that I
                can do a very good job at creating a website as long as my mom can do all the work
                for me. As a guinea pig, I am an avid and professional eater of lettuce, producer of
                intricate hay nests and hideouts, and the loudest wheeker in Pullman, WA. My
                wheeks are so loud, I scare my mom at 3 a.m. in the morning. That should tell you,
                <span class="sm-emphasis">I'm good at what I do as a guinea pig.</span> <span class="emphasis">I may not know what to do if you needed a full
                stack website, but I know I'm the best guinea pig.</span>
            </p>
